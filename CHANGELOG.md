# Changelog

All substantive design + implementation changes. Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) structure loosely. Dates are when the change was decided / committed, not shipped.

Version scheme: `v0.x.y` during pre-release (no public v1.0 yet). `v1.0.0` = first Workshop publish.

## [v0.13.0] - Map layout diagram + decontamination zones

### Added

- **[docs/03_layout.md](docs/03_layout.md)** — ASCII + mermaid **map diagrams** (topology, safe vs sealable zones). **Decontamination** rules: rounds **1–4** each **permanently seal** one of **Market, Alley, Server Vault, Rooftop Helipad** (random permutation at map load); **20s** evacuation window at round start or **death**; **Spawn, Corporate Plaza, Lab never seal** (hub + progression).
- **Perk timing**: Lab **4-of-9 perk re-roll runs only after** decontamination completes — updated [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md), [docs/06_mechanics.md](docs/06_mechanics.md) §4, [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md). Stub comment in [`_acc_map_randomizer.gsc`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) for future `acc_decontamination_complete` wait.

## [v0.12.0] - Early round pressure (faster + more zombies, rounds 1–4)

### Added

- **Design**: Opening rounds are no longer a slow stock walk phase. Rounds **1–4** use higher spawn totals and faster zombie movement so the start of a run is a deliberate **setup phase** (doors, lanes, Lab check, economy). See [docs/06_mechanics.md](docs/06_mechanics.md) § Early round pressure; [docs/04_progression_and_skills.md](docs/04_progression_and_skills.md) difficulty table.
- **Module** [`_acc_early_round_pacing.gsc`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_early_round_pacing.gsc):
  - `post_zm_main()` chains `level.max_zombie_func` to multiply stock output by **×1.40** (round 1) and **×1.35** (rounds 2–4), `ceil` to int. Multiplies with `level.acc_mod_round_zombie_mult` when set (e.g. Shortened Rounds).
  - `init()` registers `callback::on_ai_spawned` to apply **`setmovespeedscale( 1.15 )`** to zombies in rounds **1–4**. Skipped when **Sprint** modifier sets `level.acc_mod_force_sprint`.
- **Map wiring**: [`maps/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city.gsc`](maps/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city.gsc) calls `post_zm_main()` immediately after `_zm::main()` so the spawn override exists before round 1.
- **Docs**: [docs/16_gsc_reference.md](docs/16_gsc_reference.md) — `level.max_zombie_func( n_max, n_round )` delegation pattern.

### Constants (sync with docs)

- `ACC_EARLY_ROUND_MAX` = 4, `ACC_EARLY_SPAWN_MULT_R1` = 1.40, `ACC_EARLY_SPAWN_MULT` = 1.35, `ACC_EARLY_SPEED_SCALE` = 1.15.

## [Unreleased]

Tracked changes planned but not yet applied.

- Author FN FAL, Tac-19, Intervention, M14 EBR, G3, AK-47, B23R weapon GDTs (Phase 4 work).
- Author Signal Staff + Vibro Cleaver wonder weapon GSC modules.
- Author LUI widgets for all custom HUD elements (Data Shards counter, Cyberware stack, weapon status, items row, objective prompts, boss health).
- Wire ability hotkey through LUI binding screen.
- Suppress stock BO3 kill-point awards so our 40/100/100 replaces rather than adds. (Researched options documented in `_acc_points.gsc::init` comment.)

---

## [v0.11.0] - Mega Bottle perk-upgrade system

### Added

- **Empty Mega Bottle** item: guaranteed drop from every boss kill (mini + full), **1 per player**. Separate from the 6-item boss-drop pool. Counter tracked on `self.acc_mega_bottles`.
- **9 Mega perk variants** with themed names:
  - Jugger-Nog → **Ultimate Tank** (immune to boss stuns + 1 extra hit)
  - Quick Revive → **Savior** (revive at 35% time + +15% speed post-revive for both players)
  - Speed Cola → **Sleight of Hand Expert** (+65% reload + faster drink/swap/lethal)
  - Double Tap 2.0 → **Gun Slinger** (+50% fire rate)
  - Stamin-Up → **The Flash** (unlimited sprint + +10% walk + +12% sprint)
  - Mule Kick → **The Armory** (+35% ammo per gun + double grenade capacity)
  - Deadshot → **American Sniper** (+2x headshot + zero recoil)
  - Widow's Wine → **Spiderman** (grenade 1-shot zombies + hold 6)
  - Aura Blast → **Mega Man** (2x radius + 60s CD + 2 charges)
- **Mega application**: at a Lab perk machine currently dispensing a perk the player owns, consume 1 bottle → perk becomes Mega. No additional Points cost. Must be in current rotation.
- **Sticky Mega flag**: Mega state persists through death for the rest of the run. Re-buying the perk after respawn re-applies Mega automatically. Flag cleared only at run end.
- **New module** [`_acc_mega_bottles.gsc`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_mega_bottles.gsc) - bottle acquisition, inventory tracking, Mega flag storage, clientfield for HUD counter, machine-interaction entry point, display-name helpers for all 9 Mega variants.
- **HUD counter** for Mega Bottles (`Bottles: N`) adjacent to Data Shards counter, hidden when count is 0. LUI widget planned for Phase 4; `iprintln` fallback for Phase 3.

### Changed

- [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md) - major new section "Mega Bottles (upgraded perk variants)" with acquisition loop, usage rules, persistence rule, timing tension with rotation, the 9 Mega variants in detail, co-op notes, HUD notes, implementation pointers, and 4 tuning levers.
- [docs/11_enemies.md](docs/11_enemies.md) - mini-boss and full-boss entries both list the new guaranteed Mega Bottle drop.
- [docs/12_boss_items.md](docs/12_boss_items.md) - clarifies that it covers the 6-item equippable pool only, cross-references the sibling Mega Bottle system.
- [docs/14_controls_and_hud.md](docs/14_controls_and_hud.md) - new HUD element "Mega Bottle counter" (1b) adjacent to Data Shards counter.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_boss.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_boss.gsc) - both `watch_mini_boss_death` and the full-boss death path now call `_acc_mega_bottles::on_boss_death` in addition to the existing `_acc_boss_items::on_boss_death`.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_main.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_main.gsc) - new module included in init sequence + per-player connect callback.
- [zone_source/zm_abandoned_cyber_city.csv](zone_source/zm_abandoned_cyber_city.csv) - new module registered.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/README.md](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/README.md) - module table, call order, and per-player state conventions updated for Mega Bottle system.
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) - perk summary + code↔doc mapping include the new Mega system.

### Design Decisions Taken

- **Bottle cost is bottle only** (no extra Points). Base perk Points spend is the "first payment"; bottle is the "upgrade currency." Cleaner UX.
- **Must be in rotation** to apply Mega. Adds a second timing layer on top of the per-round rotation. If this feels too punishing in playtest, decouple (allow Mega at any machine regardless of rotation) — flagged as a tuning lever.
- **Per-player, not per-team**: each player gets their own bottle per boss kill. 4p co-op = 4 bottles per boss across the team.

### Known Balance Risks

- **American Sniper + full Cyberware/Overclock/PaP L5 stack** produces insane headshot damage (~100x+ on regulars, ~160x+ on boss headshots). Intended as a power fantasy; playtest decides if it crosses into "unfun-absurd."
- **Ultimate Tank "immune to boss stuns"** needs explicit scope — Phase 4 TODO. First-pass: fully skip all phase debuff effects. Could soften to 50%.
- **Double lethal/tactical capacity from The Armory** stacks with Spiderman's "hold 6" → Frag max becomes 8 (double of 4) with Armory alone, 6 cap with Spiderman, min of the two = 6. Clarified in the doc.

## [v0.10.0] - per-round perk rotation at the Lab

### Added

- **All 9 perks consolidated to the Lab** (4 perk machines: `acc_lab_perk_a/b/c/d`).
- **Per-round rotation**: at every round start (`acc_round_start` notify), machines re-roll to a random 4-of-9 perks from the full roster. No duplicates.
- New function [`_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::roll_perk_rotation(round_number)`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) that emits `acc_perk_rotation_rolled` level notify on roll.
- New function [`_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::apply_perk_rotation_to_machines(rotation)`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) that reads Radiant `targetname` lookups and sets per-machine `acc_current_specialty` (Phase 4 visual re-skin is a TODO).
- Listener loop [`_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::watch_round_for_perk_rotation()`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) that subscribes to `acc_round_start`.
- Helper [`_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::get_full_perk_roster()`](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) as the single source of truth for the 9 specialty names.

### Changed

- [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md) - slot assignment section fully rewritten: 4 Lab machines, per-round rotation, probability tables (Jug-less odds, consecutive-miss probabilities), route/patience player-adaptation notes.
- [docs/03_layout.md](docs/03_layout.md) - perk slots **removed** from Market, Corp Plaza, Server Vault, Rooftop Helipad. Lab now lists 4 perk machines. Lab's description flags it as "highest-traffic zone in the map" due to rotation visits. Randomized-elements list updated to "Perk rotation (per round)".
- [docs/07_replayability.md](docs/07_replayability.md) - perk section rewritten: per-round not per-run; probability notes; variance math updated.
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) - perk summary reflects all-Lab rotation model.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) - `pre_init` no longer rolls `state.perk_pool`; `apply_state_when_ready` no longer calls `apply_perk_pool`; `log_state` no longer logs perk slots (rotation logs its own per-round).

### Removed

- `roll_perk_pool()` function (replaced by per-round `roll_perk_rotation`).
- `apply_perk_pool()` function (replaced by `apply_perk_rotation_to_machines`).
- `state.perk_pool` field on `level.acc_map_state`.
- **Zone-distributed perk machines**: perk machines at Market / Corp / Server Vault / Rooftop Helipad are gone.
- Jug / Quick Revive "guaranteed in specific zone" rules. Both are now equal-weighted in the rotation.
- Old per-run 420-configuration count (replaced by per-round 126 rotations, 50 per run = far more variance).

### Known Tuning Risks

- **Jug-less early runs**: ~5% of runs will see no Jug until round 6+. If this feels terrible in playtest, options:
  1. Weight Jug 2x (roughly doubles appearance odds).
  2. Guarantee Jug in round 1's rotation (player gets Jug within a minute).
  3. Add a "hasn't appeared in 5 rounds" pity-timer that forces Jug next roll.
- **Lab choke during round transitions**: with 4 players all rushing to Lab simultaneously at round start, the zone could feel crowded. Playtest; consider widening Lab geometry if so.
- **Some rounds offer nothing useful**: if the RNG gives a player 4 perks they already own, the Lab trip is wasted. Intended tension but worth watching; if too frequent, add "skip-reroll button" (costs Points to force a re-roll).

## [v0.9.0] - perk overhaul

### Added

- **Aura Blast** (custom active perk, 2,500 Points) — hold [perk ability key] to stun all enemies within 400u for 3s. 120s cooldown. Replaces Lattice Bond.
- **Deadshot** (custom, 3,500 Points) — +1.5x headshot multiplier + auto-aim to head when ADS. Stacks multiplicatively with our 2x/3x headshot system. Auto-aim disabled against bosses. Replaces Void Cache.
- **Widow's Wine** (custom, 4,000 Points) — stock web-grenade mechanics + +50% damage/radius to both Frag Grenade and EMP Grenade. New addition.
- **No 4-perk cap** — stock BO3's per-player limit is explicitly removed in this map. Players can hold all 9 perks simultaneously.
- **Perk ability hotkey** (`acc_perk_ability` notify, default G / D-pad Up) — separate from weapon ability hotkey so players can chain both. Documented in [docs/14_controls_and_hud.md](docs/14_controls_and_hud.md).
- **Baseline HP rule** documented: 3 zombie melee hits to die without Jug, 6 hits with Jug. Authoritative tuning target.
- **Per-run perk lockout** — 4 of 7 rotatable perks are excluded per run (randomized). 420 distinct configurations possible.
- Console logging added to `_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::roll_perk_pool` for the 4 locked-out perks so playtest can see run state.

### Changed

- **Jugger-Nog** cost: stock 2,500 → **4,000**. HP doubling preserved.
- **Quick Revive** cost: 500/1,500 → **2,500**. Added **+30% health regen speed after damage**. Faster-revive preserved.
- **Speed Cola** cost: 3,000 → **3,500**. Added **faster perk drinking** + **faster equipment change**. +50% reload preserved.
- **Stamin-Up**: speed buff **+5% → +10%**. Changed **unlimited sprint → extended sprint** (~2x stock duration). Significant nerf to stock behavior.
- **Mule Kick** cost: stock 4,000 → **3,000**.
- **Double Tap 2.0**: unchanged.
- Perk total: 8 → **9** (added Widow's Wine; replaced Lattice Bond + Void Cache with Aura Blast + Deadshot + Widow's Wine).
- [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md) fully rewritten with new tuning, the "Swiss Army Player" full-stack example, implementation status, and tuning levers.
- [docs/12_boss_items.md](docs/12_boss_items.md) Ghost Shroud stacking notes updated (no longer references Lattice Bond; now references Jug + Aura Blast for the clutch-survival layer).
- [docs/06_mechanics.md](docs/06_mechanics.md) - Deadshot effective damage table added; stacking chain updated; Void Cache notes in co-op section replaced with Widow's Wine + Deadshot notes.
- [docs/07_replayability.md](docs/07_replayability.md) - perk roster list corrected to 9-perk set; build archetype notes updated.
- [docs/05_weapons.md](docs/05_weapons.md) - removed inline Lattice Bond / Void Cache perk descriptions; now delegates entirely to [13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md) with a weapon-relevance summary.
- [docs/16_gsc_reference.md](docs/16_gsc_reference.md) section 5 - custom perk creation example updated to Aura Blast (active-perk pattern). Added patterns for active perks, damage-modifier perks, and grenade-boost perks.
- [docs/08_milestones.md](docs/08_milestones.md) Phase 4 deliverables - custom perk list updated.
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) - perk summary updated to 9 perks + no cap + 3/6 HP rule.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_map_randomizer.gsc) - `roll_perk_pool` updated to 7-perk rotatable pool, logs 4 locked-out per run.

### Removed

- **Lattice Bond** perk (replaced by Aura Blast).
- **Void Cache** perk (replaced by Deadshot - different role but same "3rd custom perk" slot).
- **4-perk cap** enforcement.

### Tuning Notes

Watch in playtest:
- Deadshot + 3x boss headshot multiplier + Overload Cyberware + Precision Mode ability = absurd boss-damage stack. Tuning levers in [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md).
- Widow's Wine damage boost on Frag might make Meltdown-capstone grenade spam dominant. Consider reducing +50% to +25% if this validates.
- Aura Blast 2,500 is cheap for what it does (on-demand 3s AoE stun). Could bump to 3,000-3,500 if it trivializes mid-game.

## [v0.8.0] - BO3 API research + verified fixes

### Added

- **[docs/16_gsc_reference.md](docs/16_gsc_reference.md)** — BO3 GSC/CSC language + API reference doc. Verified signatures (via modme forums, bo3explorer, UGX Mods wiki) for `callback::on_ai_damage`, `_zm_score::add_to_player_score`, `clientfield::register`, `zombie_killed` notify, common utility modules, custom perk workflow, custom weapon import workflow, debug loop, common gotchas.
- **[docs/17_reference_maps_study.md](docs/17_reference_maps_study.md)** — Design patterns study covering Ameliorama I/II, Machin[a], Shadows of Evil, Der Eisendrache, Origins. What we took from each, what we explicitly rejected, open questions, maps queued for future study.

### Changed

- **[scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_damage.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_damage.gsc)** — `on_ai_damage` callback signature corrected to canonical BO3 order: `(str_mod, str_hit_location, v_hit_origin, e_player, n_amount, w_weapon, ...)`. Previous approximated order was wrong. Added `weapon_root_name()` helper to handle weapon struct vs string gracefully.
- **[scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_points.gsc](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/_acc_points.gsc)** — `award_player()` now uses `player _zm_score::add_to_player_score(pts)` instead of direct `player.score += pts`, so HUD floaters and VO cues fire correctly. Added `#using scripts\zm\_zm_score;`.
- Stock-kill-award suppression TODO upgraded to a concrete research plan in `_acc_points.gsc::init()` with three possible community-standard paths.
- **[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)** — new "Reference Material" section indexing the two new docs. Code↔doc mapping annotates which scripts reference the GSC reference for verified APIs.

### Resolved TODO(acc-verify) markers

- `_acc_data_shards.gsc` — `clientfield::register` signature verified.
- `_acc_data_shards.gsc` — `is_player_alive` now documented to prefer `_zm_utility::is_player_valid` when available, with a manual fallback.
- `_acc_utility.gsc` — `level.players` iteration pattern confirmed as canonical.
- `_acc_damage.gsc` — zombie team string `"axis"` confirmed.
- `_acc_events_hack.gsc` — `"head"` / `"helmet"` hit locations confirmed for headshot detection.
- `_acc_points.gsc` — `MOD_MELEE` / `MOD_MELEE_WEAPON_BUTT` / `MOD_MELEE_ASSASSINATION` as the knife MOD strings.

### Remaining TODO(acc-verify) markers

Still need first-Mod-Tools-compile verification:

- `_acc_overclocks.gsc` PaP suffix naming (exact strings).
- `_acc_map_randomizer.gsc` Mystery Box weapon registration API call shape.
- `_acc_elites.gsc` zombie spawn + promotion pipeline (stock flow is tangled; community helpers exist).
- `_acc_modifiers.gsc` `util::waittill_round` stock helper existence.
- `_acc_cyberware.gsc` exact move-speed multiplier API (`setmovespeedscale` or equivalent).

These are documented in the code with current best-guess implementations and fallback strategies.

---

## [v0.7.0] - Payroll Ledger (6th boss-drop item)

### Added

- **Payroll Ledger** boss-drop item (implant slot): +10% Points on any kill the wearer contributes to. Applied after the 70/30 co-op split (on the player's share, not the base award).
- Boss-item pool expanded from 5 to 6 items. Player inventory still 2 slots; drop chance unchanged (mini 50%, full 100%); duplicate → 3 Shards unchanged.
- `ACC_POINTS_LEDGER_MULT = 1.10` constant in `_acc_points.gsc`.
- `ACC_ITEM_LEDGER_POINTS_MULT = 1.10` constant in `_acc_boss_items.gsc` (exposed for cross-module reference).
- Helper `_acc_boss_items::player_has_ledger()`.
- Stacking rules documented: multiplicative with Double Points, independent from Void Cache tokens, cannot stack with itself.

### Changed

- [docs/12_boss_items.md](docs/12_boss_items.md) - updated item count throughout, new "Why 2 slots out of 6" rationale, new synergistic combo examples (Ledger + Battery, Ledger + Shroud), tuning levers updated.
- [docs/05_weapons.md](docs/05_weapons.md) - boss-items cross-reference updated to 6 items + Ledger interaction note.
- [docs/13_perks.md](docs/13_perks.md) - Void Cache section adds Ledger stacking note.
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) - item pool size and per-system summary updated.
- [scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/README.md](scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/README.md) - module table updated to reflect dependency on `_acc_points.gsc` for the Ledger bonus.

### Fixed

- Stale "Overclock Active Pool" text in [docs/07_replayability.md](docs/07_replayability.md) that described the pre-Tier-1-5 design ("3 per family, rerolled per run"). Replaced with the current per-tier-up draw model matching [05_weapons.md](docs/05_weapons.md).

---

## [v0.6.0] - docs established as requirements

### Added

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` at repo root. Master index of every game system with change-control policy. Designated as the authoritative requirements document.
- `docs/13_perks.md` - full perk spec (6 stock + 2 custom perks, per-run slot randomization rules, custom perk cooldown details, stacking/interaction rules, tuning levers).
- `docs/14_controls_and_hud.md` - input bindings, HUD element list with layout sketch, LUI widget file plan, accessibility notes.
- `docs/15_coop_rules.md` - consolidated co-op behavior (HP scaling, spawn-rate scaling, revive rules, per-player vs shared resources, item pickup priority, side-event activator gating).
- `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root.

### Changed

- Audited existing docs; fixed stale references to removed weapons (Sheiva, HVK-30, Gorgon, Kuda, M1911, Argus) and to the old PaP II system in `03_layout.md`, `06_mechanics.md`, `07_replayability.md`.

---

## [v0.5.0] - weapon progression overhaul + boss items

### Added

- PaP L1-L5 system (money track, 5k / 7.5k / 10k / 12.5k / 15k, cumulative +20% damage + 1 reserve mag per level, 50k total to max).
- Tier 1-5 system (Shards track, 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5, each tier unlocks 1 Overclock slot, 15 Shards total to max).
- Per-category weapon abilities: Triple Tap, Stabilizer, Precision Mode, Slug Round, Thermal Vision, Whirlwind, Extended Fuse, Overcharge.
- Boss-drop item system: 5 items (Neural Boots, Overclocked Gauntlets, Targeting Visor, Kinetic Battery, Ghost Shroud), 2 player slots, mini-boss 50% / full boss 100% drop chance, duplicates → 3 Shards.
- New modules: `_acc_weapon_abilities.gsc`, `_acc_boss_items.gsc`.
- New doc `docs/12_boss_items.md`.

### Changed

- `_acc_overclocks.gsc` refactored: removed "per-run 3 active per family" roll; replaced with per-weapon tier-up draw system.
- `_acc_boss.gsc` now triggers boss-item drops on death.
- Overclock pools no longer re-rolled per run; full family pool is draftable across tier-ups.
- Docs `04_progression_and_skills.md` updated with per-sink Shard spend table showing round 30 decision tension.

---

## [v0.4.0] - kill-point overhaul + headshot multiplier

### Added

- Headshot damage multiplier: 2x regular / 3x boss, multiplicative with stock per-weapon headshot multiplier. Tac-19 explicitly excluded.
- Kill-point replacement system: 40 regular / 100 headshot / 100 knife.
- Co-op kill-point split: 70% killer / 30% pool split among qualifying damage contributors. Solo = 100%.
- Anti-exploit rules (7 hard-enforced): min-contribution threshold, per-player damage cap at maxhealth, per-player aggregation, environmental damage exclusion, disconnect handling, invalid-killer fallback, integer rounding remainder-to-pool.
- New modules: `_acc_damage.gsc`, `_acc_points.gsc`.

### Changed

- `docs/06_mechanics.md` Point Economy section fully rewritten with example payout tables.

---

## [v0.3.0] - wonder weapons and sniper rework

### Added

- Two wonder weapons: **Signal Staff** (ranged, counters Subroutine Core with +300%) and **Vibro Cleaver** (wonder melee, counters Juggernaut Host with +300%).
- Wonder weapon craft gating: Signal Staff requires Vault Overload completion, Vibro Cleaver requires Hack Terminal completion (+ 5 Shards each).
- Boss counter pairings documented in [docs/11_enemies.md](docs/11_enemies.md).

### Changed

- Sniper tier swap: Drakon promoted to **strong** (box), Intervention demoted to **normal** (wallbuy), Locus remains **bad** (box).
- Replaced previous "candidates" (Nanite Swarm / EMP Railgun / Code Injection Pistol) with committed Signal Staff + Vibro Cleaver.
- Tac-19 design locked: no headshot multiplier applies; base damage bumped to compensate; **best crowd-control gun** in the roster.

### Removed

- Wonder weapon candidate list; those three are now "post-1.0" ideas at most.

---

## [v0.2.0] - 16-weapon roster finalized

### Added

- 3-tier-per-category weapon structure: normal (wallbuy), bad (box), strong (box).
- Final roster of 16 weapons locked:
  - Pistol: B23R (import, starter).
  - Shotgun: Haymaker 12 / Brecci / Tac-19.
  - AR full-auto: ICR-1 / XR-2 / AK-47.
  - Semi-auto AR: M14 EBR / G3 / FN FAL (all imports).
  - Sniper: Drakon / Locus / Intervention.
  - Melee: Bowie Knife.
  - Grenades: Frag + EMP Grenade (custom tactical).
- Mystery Box pool registered in `_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::register_mystery_box_pool`.

### Removed

- Previous short-list weapons that didn't survive roster review: Sheiva, HVK-30, Kuda, Argus, Bulldog, Gorgon, BRM, M1911.

---

## [v0.1.0] - weapons and enemies docs split

### Added

- `docs/05_weapons.md` (weapons-only; extracted from combined `05_weapons_and_enemies.md`).
- `docs/11_enemies.md` (enemies-only, bestiary).

### Removed

- `docs/05_weapons_and_enemies.md` (replaced by two docs above).

---

## [v0.0.0] - initial project scaffold

### Added

- Repo scaffold: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SETUP_WINDOWS.md`.
- Design docs 00-10 covering overview, toolchain, learning path, layout, progression, mechanics, replayability, milestones, language/publishing, today-quickstart.
- Radiant entry scripts: `maps/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city.gsc` + `.csc`.
- 12 GSC modules under `scripts/zm/zm_abandoned_cyber_city/` covering custom data shards, cyberware, elites, events, emergency drop, modifiers, boss, map randomizer, main orchestrator, utility helpers.
- Zone source CSV.
- Windows sync tooling (`tools/sync_to_modtools.ps1`).

## Change Entry Guidance (for future updates)

When changing the game, append a new section following this template:

```markdown
## [vX.Y.Z] - brief title

### Added
- ...

### Changed
- ...

### Removed
- ...

### Fixed
- ...
```

Keep entries tight: one line per change, link to the doc the change applies to.

Increment:
- **x** when the change breaks previous design (e.g. replacing a whole system).
- **y** when adding new systems or substantial reworks.
- **z** for bug fixes, tuning pass deltas, small doc edits.

For every entry, update the corresponding detailed doc in `/docs` and the summary in `REQUIREMENTS.md` if the change is visible at that level.
