# BO3 Zombies Mapmaking — Reusable Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** everything hard-won building `zm_abandoned_cyber_city`, distilled

> Replace `<map>` with your map name (e.g. `zm_my_new_map`). This is the doc to
> copy into a new project and read first. Project-specific notes live in
> CLAUDE.md; this is the portable layer.

## Mindset: HACKY IS GOOD — you don't own the engine

Custom BO3 maps are **not production code**, and you control only the GSC/CSC/Radiant
surface Treyarch exposed — not the engine, not stock scripts. So **when no clean API
exists for what you want (common), the correct move is a creative hack using whatever
lever the engine *does* give you.** Hacks are encouraged, not a compromise. Pattern:
(1) confirm there's no first-class API (check the stock-API ledger + community ledger);
(2) find any engine behavior that produces the effect as a side-effect; (3) ship it;
(4) document the hack + *why* (code comment + doc + memory) so it's reused, not
re-discovered. Worked examples from this map: **"disable" volumetric fog by pushing its
start plane to ~100,000,000 units** (there is NO fog-off builtin — even stock `_art.gsc`
resorts to this); HUD via clientfields because `.csc` can't call `.gsc`; surface re-skin
by swapping the brush-face **material token** (face materials need no `.zone` line);
delivering the cold cyber-night haze through a **scripted `SetVolFog`** pass (there's no
Radiant knob for the exact look), layered over the map's **baked** neon lights +
reflection probes (§1); **finish a stock-but-unfinished
pipeline from your own side** (this map completes the shipped-broken Electric Cherry perk
in `_acc_perk_electric_cherry`). **A working hack beats a "clean" solution that's blocked
by code you can't edit.**

## 0. Quick reference (the commands that actually work)

```powershell
# One-command headless build (asset-gate -> sync -> cod2map64 -> LED -> linker -> verify .ff).
# The user's job is to TEST, not compile — build it yourself.
.\tools\build_map.ps1              # FULL: any .map / brush / entity / material / sky change
.\tools\build_map.ps1 -GscOnly     # FAST: GSC/CSC/.zone/.csv-only change (reuses the last BSP)
.\tools\build_map.ps1 -Run         # build, then launch on success

# Fast bake gate after ANY geometry/material/sky change (cod2map + LED; prints BAKED/CRASHED)
.\tools\_bake_test.ps1 "<tools>\map_source\zm\<map>.map"

# Launch (THE one load-bearing arg is +set_gametype zclassic)
.\tools\run_game.ps1
start "" "steam://run/311210//+set fs_game <map> +set_gametype zclassic +devmap <map> +set developer 1 +set logfile 1"
```

`build_map.ps1` wraps the raw pipeline below (run by hand if you need to):

```powershell
.\tools\sync_to_modtools.ps1                      # linker builds the DEPLOYED copy, not your repo
# GSC-only change: just the linker (geometry/BSP reused):
& "<tools>\bin\linker_modtools.exe" -language english -modsource <map>
# GEOMETRY changed — full pipeline, in order (cod2map64 MUST run with cwd = <tools>\bin):
& "<tools>\bin\cod2map64.exe" -platform pc -navmesh -navvolume -loadFrom "<tools>\map_source\zm\<map>.map" "<tools>\share\raw\maps\zm\<map>.d3dbsp"
& "<tools>\bin\radiant_modtools.exe" -ledSilent +medium +localprobes +forceclean +recompute "<tools>\map_source\zm\<map>.map"
& "<tools>\bin\linker_modtools.exe" -language english -modsource <map>
```

`<tools>` on the dev box = `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III 455130` (Steam appends the AppID `455130` on name collision — the game itself is the folder without it). Detect the tools root by the presence of `bin\modlauncher.exe`, never by folder name.

---

## 1. Build pipeline

The Mod Tools build is **4 stages**; `build_map.ps1` runs them headless (no Launcher GUI):

| Stage | Tool | Produces | Re-run when |
|---|---|---|---|
| GDT DB | `gdtdb.exe /update` | asset DB | GDTs changed |
| Map/BSP | `cod2map64.exe ... -navmesh -navvolume` | `.d3dbsp` + navmesh/navvolume `.hkt` | **geometry** changed |
| Lighting | `radiant_modtools.exe -ledSilent +recompute` | LED lightmap (`.led`) | geometry/lights/probes changed |
| Link | `linker_modtools.exe -modsource <map>` | the `.ff` fastfile | **any** change (compiles GSC + packs) |

- **Build success = a FRESH `.ff` was written, NOT the linker exit code.** The linker prints `ERROR: … not found in gdtDB` for missing-but-substituted assets and exits nonzero, yet still packs a valid `.ff`. `build_map.ps1` waives those and fails only if no fresh `.ff` lands.
- **The linker compiles GSC from the DEPLOYED `usermaps\<map>\scripts` copy, NOT your repo.** Edit → **sync** → build, every time. Skipping the sync silently builds stale code and you chase a ghost ("I changed it but nothing changed in game"). Cost us hours. Verify a deploy landed (file size/mtime) before trusting a build.
- For **GSC-only** changes, `-GscOnly` runs *only the linker* — the BSP from the last `cod2map64` is reused. ~seconds. NOT valid if any brush/entity/material moved.
- **`cod2map64` MUST run with cwd = `<tools>\bin`** or navmesh gen aborts (`ERROR: Unable to load navigation mesh generation settings`) **while still writing the `.d3dbsp`** — the build looks fine but `_navmesh.hkt` is stale → zombies path the OLD geometry. (`build_map.ps1` handles the cwd.)
- **The navmesh IGNORES all entities** (`radiant\configs\navmesh.json` `exclusions`: `misc_model`, `script_model`, `script_brushmodel`, `dyn_model`, `clip_player/missile/weapon/vehicle/physics`, triggers, volumes). Only **worldspawn brushes** cut the mesh at compile (`clip` and `clip_ai` are NOT excluded; carve-only materials exist: `clip_carver`/`clip_navmesh_carver`/`clip_navvolume_carver` — nav cut without player collision). So ANY entity-based collision (a script_brushmodel clip, a script_model with a `_col` LOD) is a solid the pathfinder can't see: **zombies path onto the footprint and grind on the prop until their target moves** (stock targeting never re-picks a merely-unreachable target). The runtime fix is stock's own: **`<ent> DisconnectPaths()`** — every stock perk machine (`_zm_perks.gsc:1551-1555`) and PaP (`_zm_pack_a_punch.gsc:114-118`) spawns collision then immediately disconnects; door slabs auto-disconnect (`_zm_blockers.gsc:272-275`). Pair every later `NotSolid()` with `ConnectPaths()`. (The API doc says a script_brushmodel needs the DYNAMICPATH spawnflag for this — in practice plain .map-authored brushmodels take it fine.) No other dynamic ground-nav primitive exists in T7 (no NavTrace/SpawnNavObstacle/BlockNavmesh). Ours: `_acc_map_randomizer.gsc::manage_prop_clip_navmesh` sweeps all `acc_clip_*`/`acc_box_clip_*`. Full ledger entry: docs/16 "Navmesh ignores ALL entity collision". Debug render: `developer 1` + `ai_shownavmesh 1`.
- Link order matters: geometry/gfx assets convert **before** scriptparsetree GSC compiles. A geometry-asset error aborts the build before GSC is ever tested — clear geometry errors first.
- The linker **stops at the first error** and compiles `#using`'d modules in order. A clean run validates everything up to the break point.
- `cod2map64` warns "NavVolume generation is skipped" when there's no `nav_volume` brush — harmless for ground-only zombies.

### The LED lightmap-atlas ceiling (durable reference)

BO3 lighting is **baked** — a `.led` lightmap (~75 MB) is computed by the Radiant lightmapper and bundled into the `.ff` at link. On some maps the bake **hard-crashes**:

```
SANITY CHECK FAILURE (Result == ((HRESULT)0L))
…\bin\Radiant_modtools.exe   q:\t7\pc\code\tools\radiant\brush.cpp:1860
```

Under `-ledSilent` the crash modal is **not** suppressed, so it presents as a 200s+ **hang** with no `.led` written. This is **NOT a per-brush geometry defect** — adding a *clone of a known-good brush*, or a plain box in an empty room, crashes an otherwise-clean map identically. It is a **lightmap-ATLAS overflow**:

- A script-generated `.map` emits the unpacked placeholder `lightmap_gray 16384 16384 0 0 0 0` on **every lit face** → ~90% of faces pile on the same atlas offset `(0,0)`. (A shipped, Radiant-authored map like `zm_alien_isolation` bakes thousands of faces fine — its lit faces all carry **unique packed** lightmap UVs; only clip/tool faces sit at `0,0`.)
- Radiant repacks those colliding charts at bake time; with the uniform placeholder scale the atlas fills at a low, **fragile** surface budget → adding almost any surface overflows a per-page D3D `CreateTexture` allocation → the assert. The ceiling is **content/packing-specific, not a scalar triangle count** — a map with *fewer* triangles than a baking baseline can still crash.

What works vs what doesn't:
- ✅ **Stay under the surface budget.** Reverting over-budget geometry back below the ceiling restores the bake — this project's map **bakes again today**, so `build_map.ps1` runs the LED pass **by default** and **`-SkipLED` is a RED FLAG** that hides a lightmapper regression, not a routine switch. Heavy new geometry can re-hit the wall — gate every geometry change with `_bake_test.ps1`.
- ❌ **Rewriting the `.map` lightmap offsets in text is INERT** (`tools/pack_lightmap_uvs.js` proved this): Radiant re-derives its own atlas from geometry/materials and **ignores** the `.map` offsets. The only in-tool repack is Radiant **GUI** Select-All → recompute → Save, which the headless pipeline can't drive.
- ❌ **Deleting the `.led`** links fine but renders **fullbright pure white** (greybox base color is `1.0`, so with no baked light every face is blown out).
- **Historical (atlas-crisis era):** while the bake was down, the dark look could ride **LED-free** levers — scripted fog + a runtime `VisionSetNaked` grade (linker-only, overwriting the baked light) — so baked-light *quality* wasn't on the critical path. **That is no longer the stance:** the map **bakes today** and the shipped look now leans on **baked neon lights + reflection probes** (§4), with the custom vision grade **dormant** (`_acc_atmosphere.gsc` `ACC_VISION_ON 0` — it read worse than stock on flat greybox, so the map ships base-game colours). Full saga + the ~50-bake investigation: `BO3_MAPMAKING_KB.md`.

## 2. Launch & run (the saga, distilled)

Four independent gotchas; all four must be satisfied to get a playable match:

1. **Split-install junction.** Linker writes the `.ff` into the *tools* `usermaps`, but the game loads `usermaps` from the *game* folder. Junction them: `mklink /J "<game>\usermaps" "<tools>\usermaps"`. (`sync_to_modtools.ps1` auto-creates it.)
2. **Steam DRM.** A raw `BlackOps3.exe` launch is refused ("Steam must be running" → exits). Need `steam_appid.txt` = `311210` next to the exe **and** launch *through Steam* (`steam://run/311210//<args>`), not the raw exe. The Mod Tools Launcher's **"Run" checkbox launches the raw exe → don't use it** on a split install.
3. **Gametype = `+set_gametype zclassic`, NOT `+set g_gametype zclassic`.** `g_gametype` is a dvar the engine **resets to the session default** (`callbacks_shared.gsc`: `zclassic` for ZM, `tdm` for MP), so a plain `+set` never survives → falls back to `tdm` → `Com_ERROR: Script file not found: 'scripts/zm/gametypes/tdm.gsc'` → **black screen**. `set_gametype` is the engine command the Launcher itself uses (its "Set a gametype to load with map" knob); it sticks.
4. **Steam Launch Options must be EMPTY** when using `steam://run//<args>` — Steam *appends* them, producing a **doubled command line** that re-corrupts the gametype. Pick ONE arg source.

**Canonical launch:** see §0. Repo wraps it in `PLAY_TEST_MAP.bat` / `tools\run_game.ps1`.

**Steam launch-jam (automation hazard):** force-killing `BlackOps3.exe` (`Stop-Process`) + rapid `steam://run` relaunches makes Steam **silently ignore** launch requests (no process, no log). Fix: fully restart Steam (`steam.exe -shutdown`, relaunch, wait for full connect). Interactive user launches are unaffected. Don't hammer relaunches in a loop.

---

## 3. GSC dialect (BO3 ≠ WaW/BO1/BO2)

**Three languages / one asset format.** **GSC** = GameScript, server-side gameplay (~95% of custom code). **CSC** = ClientScript — same language, separate VM, runs on each player's machine (HUD glue, local FX/sound). **LUI** = a Lua UI framework for menus/HUD widgets. **GDT** = Game Data Table, plain key/value asset definitions (weapons, materials, sounds, FX), edited through APE. You write mostly GSC; touch LUI only for a real UI; edit GDTs to define assets.

- `function` keyword on **every** definition. `#using` not `#include`. `#insert` for `.gsh`/`.gsh` macros. `&func` / `&ns::func` for pointers; call a pointer as `obj [[ ptr ]]( args )`.
- `#namespace x;` **after** every `#using`/`#insert`/`#define`/`#precache` (it terminates the preamble). A `#using` after `#namespace` = `unexpected TOKEN_USING`.
- Stock namespaces drop the file's leading underscore: `_zm_utility.gsc` → `zm_utility::`. Convention here: `_acc_main.gsc` → `acc_main::`.
- **No `_zm::main()`.** Usermaps bootstrap via `zm_usermap::main()` (calls `load::main()`). Entry scripts live in `scripts/zm/`, NOT `maps/zm/`.
- **Ternary must be fully paren-wrapped:** `( cond ? a : b )`. Bare `= cond ? a : b` or `return cond ? a : b` fail. No general ternary operator — it's a parenthesized-primary production.
- **No `.field` on a parenthesized expression:** `( call() ).name` errors; `call().name` is fine. Use a temp var for the paren case.
- **Reserved keywords:** `class` (TOKEN_CLASS), likely `new`. `type` is NOT reserved (stock uses it as a param).
- **Cross-module call needs BOTH** the `#using` AND the function to exist. Stock macro needs its `#insert`. `tools/lint_gsc_xref.js` statically verifies all four classes — run it before every build.
- **`.csc` (client VM) cannot call `.gsc` (server VM).** HUD/clientfield work that must be client-side needs real `.csc` modules; the *only* server→client channel is a clientfield (§5).
- **State conventions:** `self` = the entity the fn runs on; `level` = world/global; `game` = cross-restart. No classes — use `spawnstruct()` for records; fields spring into being on assignment. Prefix custom state `self.acc_*` / `level.acc_*` and custom events `acc_*` so they never collide with stock.
- **`isdefined()` everywhere.** Accessing an undefined field throws a script runtime error; a `string/entity == undefined` comparison itself throws — guard with `isdefined()` (including disconnected players in snapshot arrays).
- **Threading / endon discipline:** `thread fn()` = concurrent coroutine; `wait(n)` (real seconds); `waittill("evt", args…)`; `notify("evt", args…)`; `endon("evt")` kills the thread when the event fires. **Always** `endon("disconnect")` on a player thread, `endon("death")` on an entity thread, `endon("end_game")` on a level thread — a leaked loop outlives its owner and throws on freed state.
- `IPrintLnBold` on a player shows in `console_mp.log` as `[ SCRIPTER] [msg]...` — great for proof-of-life. The `/# … #/` dev-block (`/# println("…") #/`, dev builds only) does NOT reliably route to that log.

---

## 4. Map anatomy (Radiant entity recipes, verified)

Stock prefabs live in `<tools>\map_source\_prefabs\zm\zm_core\`. Inline structs are equivalent to the prefabs (shipped maps do both). Radiant map sources live in `<tools>\map_source\zm\`, never under `usermaps\`.

- **Player spawns:** `script_struct` targetname `initial_spawn_points` (script_int 1..4, noteworthy `initial_spawn`).
- **Zones:** `info_volume` noteworthy `player_volume`, targetname `<zone>`, target `<zone>_spawners`. A zone only exists once `zone_init` runs — reached via `zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone(a, b, flag)` or the `manage_zones` init list. The entry script wires the graph in `<map>::main()`.
- **Zombie spawn locations:** `script_struct` targetname `<zone>_spawners`, noteworthy `riser_location` / `dog_location`. One `actor_spawner_zm_factory_zombie` per map drives them.
- **Buyable doors:** `trigger_use` targetname `zombie_door`, `target <door_slab>`, `zombie_cost <n>`, `script_flag <enter_x>`. The `<door_slab>` = `script_brushmodel` (same targetname as the trigger's `target`) with `script_vector "0 0 130"` + `script_transition_time` (slides up on purchase). Stock `_zm_blockers::door_init` `flag::init`s the `script_flag` during load.
  - **To re-close a door in script (e.g. a lockdown seal), FIRST check how the map OPENED it** — the inverse op differs:
    - **Force-opened in place** (a dev/auto "open whole map" that does `slab ConnectPaths(); NotSolid(); Hide()`): the slab **never moved**, it's hidden at its closed origin z[0,128]. Re-close = `slab Show(); slab DisconnectPaths(); slab Solid();` IN PLACE. **Do NOT `MoveTo`** — the slab is already at closed-position, so moving it `origin − script_vector` drops it through the floor and it stops blocking.
    - **Stock buy path** (player bought it with points): `_zm_blockers::door_classify` auto-sets `script_string="move"`, so on purchase the slab `MoveTo`s `origin + (0 0 130)` and stays solid UP at z+130. There, `show/solid` in place floats a slab above the gap — instead drive the stock CLOSE `slab.door_moving = undefined; slab thread zm_blockers::door_activate(time, false)` (MoveTo back down).
  - **Crush-safety either way:** never `Solid()` a slab a player is standing in (it can stick→eject→OOB-kill). Gate it: only `Solid()` when no `GetPlayers()[i] IsTouching(slab)` (stock `door_solid_thread`, `_zm_blockers.gsc:1104`); re-assert on a ~1s loop so it solidifies once the doorway clears.
- **Perk machines:** `script_struct` targetname `zm_perk_machine`, `script_noteworthy` = specialty (e.g. `specialty_armorvest`), `model` = vending model, optional `script_string` location filter (`<gametype>_perks_<location>`).
- **Pack-a-Punch:** `misc_prefab` model `_prefabs/zm/zm_core/vending_weapon_upgrade_spawnable.map`, `script_string <gametype>_perks_<location>`.
- **Wallbuys:** `script_struct` targetname `weapon_upgrade` (`zombie_weapon_upgrade` = class weapon name, `target` → a second struct carrying the world `model`). Chalk decal optional.
- **Mystery box:** `zbarrier_zmcore_MagicBox` (+ `treasure_chest_use` trigger, `zombie_cost`). Single-chest maps ignore `level.start_chest_name`.
- **Power switch:** `_prefabs/zm/zm_core/power_switch.map`. Power = the `"power_on"` FLAG.
- **Template skybox trap:** the stock zm template `volume_sun` ships MP sky (`ssi1/ssi2` = `mp_havoc`, `ssi1_runtime_override` = `mp_havoc_overide`) → hard link error `xmodel 'skybox_mp_havoc_override' is missing`. Set all three to `default_day`. **Every new map from the template needs this.**

### Editing baked brush geometry (the `.map` plane format)

Portable whenever your `.map` is **script-generated text** (as this map's is — that's why hand-editing is safe and Radiant round-tripping is not).

**A brush = 6 plane lines in a FIXED order:** bottom (`z1`), top (`z2`), SOUTH (`-Y`/`y1`), EAST (`+X`/`x2`), NORTH (`+Y`/`y2`), WEST (`-X`/`x1`). On each plane, **only the constant-axis number is real** — the 1st number of each point (X) on E/W planes, the 2nd (Y) on N/S, the 3rd (Z) on top/bottom. Every *other* number is a **byte-identical hardcoded placeholder** emitted on every brush in the file (zero positional info) — never touch it. The plane normal is mathematically **independent** of the constant you edit (it cancels in both edge vectors), so changing `x1/x2/y1/y2/z1/z2` keeps the outward normal.

**Validity rules you can break (the only ones):**
1. Keep `x1<x2`, `y1<y2`, `z1<z2`. Crossing them makes the opposing half-spaces stop overlapping → an empty solid the BSP culls (a half-space *offset* failure, not a "normal inversion").
2. Minimum wall **20u thick / 256u tall / floor slab 16u** (20u compiled clean; thinner is untested).
3. Never make two points in one plane line coincide → the plane normal zeroes → degenerate brush.

**Hand-edit the plane constants directly** (each `Edit` is a unique-string match that fails loudly on a mis-read). **Do NOT round-trip an axis-aligned shrink through Radiant** — it re-exports ~1000 unrelated faces and rewrites every GUID/formatting, breaking by-GUID cross-checks. A by-GUID rewrite tool is worth building only when scaling the same edit across all zones.

**Watch for multiple brush families.** Different generators emit incompatible windings (e.g. a placeholder-plane family at 20u/256u vs a full-corner family at 16u/128u). Never apply one family's winding to the other.

**Fixed-vs-free wall — the core DOF rule.** A wall carrying a door/corridor **gap is FIXED** perpendicular — you can't move it without dragging the corridor floor + door slab + trigger + gap with it. A **gapless wall is FREE** to move inward, bounded only by the band the gaps occupy. If every corridor runs E-W, all gaps live on E/W walls → **N/S walls are always free; an E/W wall is free only if it carries no gap.**

**Cross-check duplicated footprints.** Room footprints get copied across several generators + the baked `.map` with no engine-level single source of truth. Keep a `source_data/rooms.json` SoT + `tools/validate_rooms.js` asserting every copy agrees — ours catches a real bug: a **double-shell** (a second generator shell overlapping the canonical room — larger in X, misaligned door gaps, a coplanar double floor + false ceiling + solid geometry poking into the live corridor). Canonical = the greybox outer room; delete the stray shell. Full mechanics + the per-zone shrink playbook: `BO3_MAPMAKING_KB.md`.

Build note: any brush move is **BSP-baked** → full pipeline (§1). A coordinate-only move needs **NO `.zone` edit** (face material tokens are never zone-listed; geometry rides in via the `col_map`/`gfx_map` `.d3dbsp` lines). Forgetting the navmesh regen (cwd=bin trap) leaves a stale `_navmesh.hkt` → zombies path the OLD footprint even though the `.ff` builds clean.

### Materials, sky & fog (atmosphere) — verified

Full plan for THIS map: `20_atmosphere_and_materials.md`. The portable rules:

- **A brush face's material token IS the GDT material asset name.** In the `.map`, the name after a face's 3 plane points (greybox default `script_wall` / `script_floor_ceiling`) is the material; `cod2map64` bakes it into the BSP and the linker resolves it from any GDT in the project. Re-skin = change the token (Radiant material browser, or bulk find/replace in the plain-text `.map`).
- **Face materials need NO `.zone` line.** A shipped map (`zm_alien_isolation`) has **2** `material,` lines for **~1017** materials. Rule: referenced *by a face* → auto-pulls from the GDT, no line. Referenced only by **worldspawn/SSI/script/model** (LUT, sky material, sky xmodel, HDR image, script-decal, FX) → needs an explicit `material,`/`image,`/`xmodel,` line.
- **Stock materials ship free** (already in installed fastfiles): no GDT, no `.tif`, no `.zone` line, no license issue — just the right name. Stock libraries on disk: `<tools>\texture_assets\t7_{concrete,metal,glass,brick,asphalt,plastic,techart}.gdt` + `t7_decal_*`. Verified usable dark/wet names: `t7_concrete_bare_dark_01_wet`, `t7_concrete_floor_garage_cracked_wet_nw`, `t7_metal_duct_insulation_01_grey`, `t7_asphalt_damaged_dark_wet`. **Do NOT** copy another community map's material names (e.g. alien's `black1_plaster`/`ayz_floor`) — they're that author's *custom* GDT, absent here → "missing material", and unlicensed.
- **Sky = SSI + skyboxmodel, not a brush.** worldspawn `skyboxmodel` (inverted-sphere xmodel) + the `volume_sun` `ssi*` keys (sun-set-info asset, one per light state, carries its own skyboxmodel/sun/exposure). **Fastest ZM-safe night look, zero custom assets:** set `ssi*` to stock **`default_night`** + `skyboxmodel` to **`skybox_default_night`** (both verified present; never `mp_havoc`). Custom HDRI sky = a `sky_latlong_hdr` material + `.exr` HDR image + sky xmodel + custom SSI, and DOES need `xmodel,`/`material,`/`image,` `.zone` lines (not face-referenced).
- **Fog is script, separate from sky + vision.** `SetVolFog( startDist, halfwayDist, halfwayHeight, baseHeight, r, g, b, maxOpacity )` — 8-arg global, **0..1 float** RGB+opacity (stock `load_shared.gsc:807`). A `.vision` rawfile does color-grade ONLY (no fog), applied via `SetVisionSet`. A bare server-side `VisionSetNaked(name, blend)` sets the GLOBAL naked vision for all players (stock `_emp.gsc:428-431`; new joiners inherit it). This map's fog + optional grade: `_acc_atmosphere.gsc` (dvar-tunable; the custom grade ships OFF because it read worse than stock on flat greybox).
- **Reflection probes** (`reflection_probe` entities, injected by `tools/gen_reflection_probes.js` — this map ships ~15, one per zone + trench; ~157 `light` entities via `gen_neon_lights.js` / `gen_underground_lights.js`) are what make wet ground read as "cyberpunk city." They're **baked by the LED pass**, so a FULL LED build is required for them to appear (`-GscOnly` won't).
- **Build-step order:** world/material/sky/`volume_sun`/skybox/reflection-probe changes are **BSP-baked** → `sync` → `cod2map64` → `radiant_modtools -ledSilent +recompute` (**LED relight mandatory** or the new lighting/reflections don't appear) → `linker`; new GDT assets also need `gdtdb /update`. **Pure-script** fog/`.vision` = **linker-only**.
- **Workshop licensing:** ship only stock, self-authored, or **CC0** (ambientCG / Poly Haven / ShareTextures / Kenney — all allow bundling raw files in a game). **Never** ship textures.com/Poliigon/Quixel-Megascans/Fab (their terms forbid mod redistribution) or assets baked into another community map.

## 5. Verified stock APIs (the traps)

From `14_stock_api_verification.md` — read it before touching stock interfaces.

- **Event callbacks (dispatch verified):** `callback::on_connect(&fn)` (player joins; `self`=player), `callback::on_spawned(&fn)` (respawn/round-start/revive), `callback::on_disconnect(&fn)`, `callback::on_ai_spawned(&fn)` (any AI; `self`=actor, **no args**) all fire. **`callback::on_ai_damage` / `callback::on_ai_killed` are register-only, NEVER dispatched** in stock — a documented trap (the 13-arg "AI damage callback" on forums belongs to a *different* system). Use the real hooks below.
- **Modifying AI damage:** `zm::register_actor_damage_callback(&fn)` — `self`=victim; signature `(inflictor, attacker, damage, flags, meansofdeath, weapon, vpoint, vdir, sHitLoc, psOffsetTime, boneIndex, surfaceType)`; **`return -1`** leaves damage unchanged AND lets later callbacks evaluate; any other return becomes the final damage and short-circuits the rest. (In a **player**-damage chain the stock loop returns the FIRST non-`-1` result — a naive `return iDamage` starves god mode/effects, so read-only hooks MUST `return -1`.)
- **Per-zombie death:** `zm_spawner::register_zombie_death_event_callback(&fn)` — `self`=the dead zombie, arg=attacker; mod/hitloc live on `self.damagemod` / `self.damagelocation`. **TRAP:** `"zombie_killed"` is notified ONLY on the player, no args, and only in the insta-kill path — a `level waittill("zombie_killed")` never fires.
- **Flags:** `"power_on"` and `"initial_blackscreen_passed"` are FLAGS — use `flag::wait_till` (a bare `waittill` hangs / misses an already-set flag). `flag::exists/init/set/get`. Rounds: `level.round_number` + `level waittill("between_round_over")`.
- **Score/points:** never write `player.score` (it desyncs `pers["score"]`); use `zm_score::add_to_player_score(points)` (the "+100" floater/VO/stats; **rounds UP to a multiple of 10** — pre-quantize shares) and `zm_score::minus_to_player_score(points)` (honors the free-purchase GobbleGum). Reading `player.score` is fine.
- **Perks:** cost lives in `level._custom_perks[specialty].cost` — set it before the first purchase/machine read (in `main()`). `level.perk_purchase_limit` removes the 4-perk cap. ZM specialties: `specialty_doubletap2`, `specialty_staminup`, `specialty_armorvest`(Jug), `specialty_quickrevive`, `specialty_fastreload`(Speed), `specialty_additionalprimaryweapon`(Mule), `specialty_deadshot`, `specialty_widowswine`. **The stock `_zm_perk_electric_cherry` pipeline ships UNFINISHED — you can complete it from your own side** (this map ships a real Electric Cherry on `specialty_combat_efficiency` via `_acc_perk_electric_cherry`, and re-uses the freed `specialty_electriccherry` for a custom perk — PhD Flopper).
- **Weapons are objects** (`weapon.name`); BO3 names are class-based (`ar_accurate`=ICR-1, `shotgun_fullauto`=Haymaker, `pistol_standard`) — never `<name>_zm`. PaP base lookup: `zm_weapons::get_base_weapon(weapon)` (table-driven; note `weapon.rootWeapon.name` KEEPS the `_upgraded` suffix — don't use it for base lookup).
- **Clientfields (the ONLY server→client HUD channel):** `clientfield::register(str_type, str_name, n_version, n_bits, str_format_type)` in `init()` on the server. `str_type` scope: `"toplayer"` (per-player), `"allplayers"` (broadcast), `"world"`, `"clientuimodel"` (HUD binding). `n_bits` sizes the value (1=bool, 7=0-127). Format `"int"/"float"/"counter"`. Set with `self clientfield::set_to_player("name", value)`; read in `.csc` (or LUI via UIModel bindings). Pattern: `_acc_lui.gsc` (registers the `"clientuimodel"` HUD fields in both VMs). Note: `_acc_data_shards.gsc` is NOT an example — its old GSC-only `clientfield::register` was a map-load crash (stock registers every `"toplayer"` field in BOTH VMs) and was replaced by a server-side hudelem (reconciled to code 2026-07-11).
- **Zombies-per-round (`level.max_zombie_func`):** stock resolves the final count via `n = [[ level.max_zombie_func ]]( n_max, n_round )`. To retune, **save** the previous pointer, install your wrapper, and **delegate** to the saved pointer (preserve stock behavior), *then* multiply/cap — don't replace it wholesale. Chain it in a `post_zm_main()` (after `zm_usermap::main()`, still inside entry `main()`) so it's live before round 1. Pattern: `_acc_early_round_pacing.gsc`.
- **Zones:** `level.zones[name].volumes` (info_volume ents); `player IsTouching(volume)` tests occupancy.
- **HUD (raw hudelems, when not using a LUI kit):** `player hud::createFontString(font, scale)` (needs `#using scripts\shared\hud_util_shared`); `elem hud::setPoint("TOP_RIGHT", "TOP_RIGHT", x, y)` (underscored point names — `"BOTTOMLEFT"` silently anchors center). `elem SetText("DMG " + n)` accepts concatenated strings; `SetValue(n)` for numbers. Through-walls world marker: a hudelem with `SetShader("white", w, h)` + `SetWaypoint(true)` + `SetTargetEnt(ent)` (`"white"` is the engine built-in, zero asset risk). **`hud::create*` returns undefined on hudelem-pool-full — guard the return.**
- **Custom perk-machine hint** that isn't localized shows the raw `&"TOKEN"`. Quick fix: `trigger SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON"); trigger SetHintString("raw text")`, re-applied on a loop (the perk think re-sets hints on power changes). Proper fix: a `.str` localize pass.

## 6. Model upgrades & the T7-asset carve pipeline

Swapping a placeholder world model for a better-fitting stock BO3 xmodel. Full checklist + the shipped station remodel: `09_boss_items.md`; memory `t7-assets-dump-prop-carving`.

- **Stock xmodels need NO bundling** — they load by NAME from the base game. An upgrade = change the `setmodel()` / `model=` reference (+ its `#precache`) and, if not already present, add an `xmodel,<name>` line to your `.zone`. Build = **`-GscOnly`** (a name swap touches no geometry/BSP/lightmap — **no LED bake**).
- **The build ERRORLOG is the oracle for "does it pack."** A non-packable model logs `xmodel '<name>' is missing` and shows nothing / falls back. **Always confirm a new model in the ERRORLOG before keeping it.** Campaign-only props (many `p7_medical_*`, `*_safehouse_*`, DLC-only) log `is missing` in ZM.
- **THE TRAP: an in-GAME asset catalog (Greyhound, a Zombies session model dump) is NOT the set the LINKER can pack.** The catalog lists models loaded at *runtime*; the linker needs the model's **source asset** in the install's GDT/asset DB. For most catalog models that source is absent → `is missing`. "This whole family (zod/…) packs" is false reasoning — `p7_zm_zod_nitrous_tank` packs because *its* source happens to be installed, not because the family does.

**The escape — carve the model out of the T7 Assets dump into a GDT you own.** The multi-GB "T7 Assets" rip is an on-demand library for ANY stock BO3 prop; two repo tools author a packable GDT straight from the raw `.xmodel_bin`s:
- **`tools/xmodel_bin_inspect.js`** — decode a `.xmodel_bin` (LZ4 block after the `*LZ4*` magic): `--strings` = material names + `color:` hints; `--bounds` = vertex bounds (4-aligned token `83 93 00 00` + 3 floats) so you **size the prop from real geometry**, not by eyeballing.
- **`tools/gen_t7_carve_gdt.js`** — auto-authors the carve GDT from the bins: scans **ALL LODs** (LOD1+ can use materials LOD0 never references), material regex includes **`mtl_`/`t7_`/`sky_`/`global_`** prefixes (the non-`mtl_` trap), skips materials already in the gdtDB (the existing-asset haystack MUST include **`texture_assets\`** — stock materials do NOT live in `source_data\`), emits `BulletCollisionLOD High`.

Carve gotchas (all reusable):
- **Zone-probe first** — some DLC props already pack stock; a `-GscOnly` build with just the `xmodel,` line tells you before you carve anything.
- **Stage in a SHORT path** — the rip's deep folder names blow `MAX_PATH` on Windows.
- **`SetScale` does NOT rescale a `script_model`'s collision** — spawn props at **scale 1.0** so collision == visual, then re-cut collision clips to the new footprint (`tools/add_prop_clips.js`; `brushmodel: true` clips are LED-exempt at any depth).
- **NEVER `SetScale` a live AI / boss reskin — it's a `0xC0000005` CTD.** Reskin a boss with a headless `SetModel` (Detach the charred head, Attach a stock head) at scale 1.0; distinguish it with an eye-tint clientfield + a `.csc` body-glow FX instead of size.
- Register the carved GDT + `model_export` folders in your external-assets manifest + CREDITS (they're game-rip, **not** for redistribution).

## 7. Dev/test mode (ONE hardcoded flag, not a console)

Bake the whole test sandbox behind **a single flag resolved once at map init into a global bool** — not a pile of per-feature dvars, and never a runtime console the user has to poke. In this repo: `acc_resolve_dev_flags()` (first thing in entry `main()`) reads the `acc_dev` dvar ONCE into **`level.acc_dev`** (default `0` = ship-safe normal play; the launch scripts pass `+set acc_dev 1`) and drives the legacy sub-dvars off that one flag. To add a dev behavior, branch on `IS_TRUE(level.acc_dev)` and hardcode the value — never introduce a new toggle. **Never tell the user to "set dvar X in the console" to test something.**

**Put proof-of-life in the ENTRY script `main()`** — it provably runs (the map loads) independent of any module init, so a banner/effect there isolates "build live?" from "module init failed?". Set `level.acc_init_complete = true` at the end of your orchestrator `init()` and show it in the entry banner to distinguish "module chain finished" from "a module init threw."

Reusable dev behaviors (all gated on `level.acc_dev`):
- **Unlimited money:** loop, `if cur < floor: player zm_score::add_to_player_score(target - cur)`.
- **Unlimited shards / currency:** loop, top up your custom counter via its grant fn (clamps + syncs HUD).
- **Auto-power:** `if !(level flag::get("power_on")) level flag::set("power_on")` after `initial_blackscreen_passed` — perks/PaP/traps all gate on it.
- **Open the whole map:** for each `zombie_door` trigger, `flag::set(door.script_flag)` (guard with `flag::exists`), then on the slab do `ConnectPaths(); NotSolid(); Hide();`, then `door TriggerEnable(false)`. Walk everywhere from spawn.
- **Damage indicators:** register a read-only `zm::register_actor_damage_callback` (returns `-1`), accumulate per-player DPS, render to a HUD on a 0.2s loop.
- **Zone signage:** poll `player IsTouching` each `level.zones[z].volumes`; on change, set a top HUD + `IPrintLnBold` with the zone's display name.
- **Disable lethal hazards for free-roam:** a decontamination/zone-seal that `DoDamage`s players will kill you on an open map. Gate it off in dev; still emit any "complete" notifies downstream systems depend on.
- **Test boss on demand:** spawn a buffed normal zombie early (**announce it** with `IPrintLnBold` — it looks normal), drop reward currency in bulk on its death.

---

## 8. Verification & debugging

- **`console_mp.log`** (`<game>\console_mp.log`, needs `+set logfile 1`) is the runtime oracle. The **last** lines are the fatal error. The wall of "Could not find material/fx" (margwa/mech/DLC/`*_zm` weapon-table entries) is **normal usermap asset noise**, not the failure. `abort_on_error TRUE` (dev mode) makes any script runtime error fatal — so a *clean load* proves every init ran without throwing. (On some boxes the logfile writes nothing — fall back to persistent on-screen dev-HUD probes; a `Com_ERROR` leaves no Windows Event either.)
- **Runtime traps that pass build+lint then throw:** `string/entity == undefined` throws (guard with `isdefined`); no bare `getdvar` (use `getdvarstring(name, default)`); a `SpawnActor`'d custom aitype needs `ArchetypeZombieBlackboardInit` to locomote; `spawn_zombie` / `hud::create*` return undefined on pool-full — guard EVERY return.
- **Lints (run before every build):** `node tools/lint_gsc_xref.js` (xref/#using/macro/paren-field) + `tools/preflight_windows.ps1` (brace/paren balance, `#namespace` order, ternary paren-wrap, reserved keywords, zone↔module consistency, LF endings, install detection, `validate_rooms.js`).
- **Adversarial pipeline audits** were decisive for the stale-deploy bug — when "the code looks right but behaves wrong," an independent audit of the *pipeline/deploy* (not just the code) finds it.

## 10. Repo tooling (portable scripts)

- `tools/build_map.ps1` — one-command headless build (`-GscOnly` fast path, `-Run` to launch, `-SkipLED` is a RED FLAG).
- `tools/_bake_test.ps1` — fast LED gate (cod2map + LED, prints BAKED / CRASHED).
- `tools/sync_to_modtools.ps1` — repo ↔ Mod Tools mirror; auto-creates the junction + `steam_appid.txt` on split installs. `-Reverse` pulls `.map` edits back.
- `tools/preflight_windows.ps1` — ~25 readiness checks (run any time).
- `tools/lint_gsc_xref.js` — static GSC cross-reference/dialect lint.
- `tools/validate_rooms.js` — asserts every duplicated room-footprint copy agrees with `source_data/rooms.json`.
- `tools/run_game.ps1` / `PLAY_TEST_MAP.bat` — DRM-safe launch (the canonical command).
- `tools/check_external_assets.ps1` — must be all-green before a build (game-rip packs aren't in git).
- Model carve: `tools/xmodel_bin_inspect.js`, `tools/gen_t7_carve_gdt.js`, `tools/add_prop_clips.js` (§6).
- Atmosphere: `tools/gen_reflection_probes.js`, `tools/gen_neon_lights.js`.
- Local stock-scripts mirror (agents/greps depend on it):
  `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zeroy99/bo3_modtools tmp/bo3_stock_ref`
- Ground-truth sources (public GitHub, verified 2026-06): pristine zm template `FanaticSoftware/Skye-Weapon-Templates` → `rex/templates/01. ZM - Base/`; shipped map w/ source `MattFiler/zm_alien_isolation`; stock GDTs `shidouri/T7-GDT-Backup`. Drop-in kits catalogued in `16_community_techniques.md`.
